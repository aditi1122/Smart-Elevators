# Smart Elevators
This is a project aimed at making the flow of the elevators in the building more smart. Previos data was used to train and after that the classfication algorithms were used to optimise the results.

Data triming was done in this project to get only the valuable data and the outlier detection in this data.

As a result trend was shown and the lift was told to go where was the max probability of the lift.
